# The Parakeet Google App Engine Receiver

This web-service runs on Google's app-engine system which should be free to use as it fits within the free usage levels.

It receives data sent over the cellular network from The Parakeet unit and then returns this information to xDrip or xDrip+ running on Android.

Step by Step instructions for installing it are availble in the [Parakeet & Google App Engine Guide PDF](https://jamorham.github.io/#parakeet)
